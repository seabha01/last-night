# Last-Night
3D Game "Last Night" developed by Hannah Seabert, Thomas Mallick, David Ross, Luba Grynyshin, Caroline Henning

Explore the club from a first-person perspective.
Player wakes up in a bar with no idea what happened the night before, 
or where his/her belongings might be. The player must fumble around the bar in a state of mild intoxication to collect 
all of his/her lost items (phone, jacket ticket, jacket, and wallet) in order to leave the bar. 

With particular deference to making the gameplay experience humorous and lighthearted, we included notes of humor with 
dancing NPC’s, comedic dialogue, and a Dance Dance Revolution-style dance-off to settle the bar tab. 

The game should likely take 5-15 minutes to complete.
